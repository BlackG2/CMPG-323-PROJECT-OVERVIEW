## Branching Strategy
The GitFlow branching strategy will be used thoughout the duration of the devleopment of these projects.
 - Gitflow branching ensures a clean state of branches at any given moment in the life cycle of project.
 - The branches naming follows a systematic pattern making it easier to comprehend.
 - It has extensions and support on most used git tools.
 - It is ideal when there it needs to be multiple version in production.
The main goal of  using this branching strategy is to have a clearer mental model with extremely separate lanes of development.
